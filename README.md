A free, open-source app for Claude and ChatGPT: an endless stream of checked olympiad-style maths tasks for grades 1–6, in any language, with a diagnosis of the child's mistake and a memory of how they are progressing.

It is neither a homework solver nor a drill of the school syllabus. It turns an adult's own Claude or ChatGPT chat into an adaptive olympiad trainer for a child in grades 1–6.

## What a lesson looks like

The adult asks in the chat for a task. The chat's model writes it, MathTrail checks it, and the child answers on the card.

Below it, a picture of the fence and five options, A to E.">

After a wrong answer, the card turns into how it went: it names the trap behind it and goes through the solution.

The progress shows the child's rank, the rank in each topic and a review for the parent.
